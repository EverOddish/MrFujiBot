# MrFujiBot

MrFujiBot is a client-side Twitch chat bot that provides information about Pokemon, similar to the OpenFuji project. MrFujiBot is meant to be a re-write of OpenFuji, where MrFujiBot provides all the same functionality without requiring Python, a Linux server, or any technical setup. MrFujiBot aims to be a stand-alone Windows/Mac desktop application that streamers can run locally on their computer.

MrFujiBot is still a work in progress.
